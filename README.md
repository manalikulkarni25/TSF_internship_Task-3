# TSF_internship_Task-3
I have explored Task 3 to explore unsupervised machine learning as data science and analytics intern at #TheSparksFoundation. This task is about to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually by usinng the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. Thank you The Sparks Foundation team for giving me this opportunity.
